## Contributing

Contributions are welcome!

The easiest way to contribute is to give this book's [Github page a star](https://github.com/aeturrell/coding-for-economists). You could also tweet/sky about it using the hashtags `#Econtwitter` and `#datascience`. Both of these help others find the book.

You can make suggestions, requests, and point out bugs or mistakes by [raising an issue](https://github.com/aeturrell/coding-for-economists/issues) on the Github repository for the book. You can also make [pull requests](https://github.com/aeturrell/coding-for-economists/pulls) with fixes, edits, or new content.

If you're thinking of making a contribution, especially of a new page, it's usually best to open an issue before starting to work on anything. This will allow you a chance to talk the new content over with the maintainers of the site. There is an official [dockerfile](https://github.com/aeturrell/coding-for-economists/blob/main/Dockerfile) for the project which may or may not be operational at any given moment! You can find more about how to use it and build the book over on the GitHub [readme](https://github.com/aeturrell/coding-for-economists#coding-for-economists).
